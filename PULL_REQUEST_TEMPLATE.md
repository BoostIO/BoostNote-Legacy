## Description
Boostnote previously showed the hour or a short date like `2d` or `21h` in the note view, *i. e.,*
the time lapse between the current time and the creation/last editing timestamp. An user made a feature request so that this timestamp could be displayed in the note view instead of the time lapse, and that's precisely the new implemented functionality.

## Issue fixed
Added a new option to the 'Interface' section of the settings menu, so that the user can opt for the previous display mode or the new one instead.
